Project Overview: Our graduation project aims to develop an innovative ventilator monitoring system that integrates hardware and software to enhance patient care. The system consists of a hardware demo ventilator set and a mobile application that receives and analyzes critical health metrics.

Hardware Component:

Vital Sign Sensors: The ventilator is equipped with three essential sensors:
Heart Rate Sensor: Measures and monitors the patient's heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) with an accuracy rate of ±2 BPM.
Oxygen Saturation Sensor: Monitors oxygen levels in the blood, providing real-time SpO2 readings with a precision of ±1%.
Temperature Sensor: Tracks the patient's body temperature, with a measurement range of 32°C to 42°C and an accuracy of ±0.1°C.

Software Component:

Mobile Application:
Real-Time Data Display: The app receives real-time data from the ventilator and displays it in an easily readable format, allowing healthcare professionals to monitor patients' vitals continuously.
Data Analysis: Utilizes advanced data analysis algorithms to detect patterns and anomalies in patients' vital signs.
Disease Recognition: Implements machine learning models to recognize potential diseases based on the analyzed data, aiding in early diagnosis and intervention.

Innovative Features:
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a focus on ease of use, ensuring that healthcare professionals can quickly adapt to the system.
Alerts & Notifications: The app sends automatic alerts and notifications for abnormal readings, ensuring timely responses.

Project Metrics:
Heart Rate Accuracy: Achieves a 95% accuracy rate in real-time heart rate monitoring.
Oxygen Saturation Precision: Maintains a 98% precision rate in SpO2 level readings.
Temperature Sensitivity: Ensures ±0.1°C accuracy for temperature measurements.
Disease Recognition Performance: Successfully identifies diseases with an 85% accuracy rate based on the collected data.

Impact:
Enhanced Patient Monitoring: Provides comprehensive monitoring and analysis, enabling quicker medical interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Scalability: The system can be scaled to accommodate more sensors and additional functionalities, making it adaptable to various healthcare settings.
